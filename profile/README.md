# Hacktoberfest 2023

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è What is Hacktoberfest?
 Hacktoberfest encourages participation in the open source community, world wide. At Intuit we support and encourage the use and creation of open source projects maintained by the community. 

## üåà Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
Start contributing to [Intuit Open Source Projects](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aintuit+topic%3Ahacktoberfest&type=repositories)! Our maintainers don't bite.

If you are non-technical, you can particpate too! Read more about [non-code contributions here](https://opensource.com/article/22/8/non-code-contribution-powers-open-source).

2. Find a project that interests you, and contribute by submitting a PR.
3. Once the PR is merged by the project maintainer, you've made your first contribution!
